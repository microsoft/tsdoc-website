## Usage

When applied to a class or interface property, this indicates that the property
returns an event object that event handlers can be attached to.  The event-handling
API is implementation-defined, but typically the property return type would be a class
with members such as `addHandler()` and `removeHandler()`.  A documentation tool can
display such properties under an "Events" heading instead of the usual "Properties" heading.


## Example

```ts
class MyClass {
  /**
    * This event is fired whenever the application navigates to a new page.
    * @eventProperty
    */
  public readonly navigatedEvent: FrameworkEvent<NavigatedEventArgs>;
}
```
