## Suggested meaning

Designates that an API item's release stage is "public".  It has been officially released to third-party developers,
and its signature is guaranteed to be stable (e.g. following Semantic Versioning rules).


## Example

```ts
/**
 * Represents a book in the catalog.
 * @public
 */
export class Book {
  /**
   * The title of the book.
   * @internal
   */
  public get _title(): string;

  /**
   * The author of the book.
   */
  public get author(): string;
};
```

In this example, `Book.author` inherits its `@public` designation from the containing class,
whereas `Book._title` is marked as "internal".
