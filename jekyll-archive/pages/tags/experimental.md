## Suggested meaning

Same semantics as `@beta`, but used by tools that don't support an `@alpha` release stage.


## Example

```ts
/**
 * Represents a book in the catalog.
 * @public
 */
export class Book {
  /**
   * The title of the book.
   * @experimental
   */
  public get title(): string;

  /**
   * The author of the book.
   */
  public get author(): string;
};
```

In this example, `Book.author` inherits its `@public` designation from the containing class,
whereas `Book.title` is marked as "experimental".
