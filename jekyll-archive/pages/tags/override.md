| Standardization: | [Extended]({% link pages/spec/standardization_groups.md %}) |
| Syntax kind: | [Modifier]({% link pages/spec/tag_kinds.md %}) |


## Usage

This modifier has similar semantics to the `override` keyword in C# or Java.  For a member function or property,
explicitly indicates that this definition is overriding (i.e. redefining) the definition inherited from the
base class. The base class definition would normally be marked as `virtual`.

A documentation tool may enforce that the `@virtual`, `@override`, and/or `@sealed` modifiers are consistently
applied, but this is not required by the TSDoc standard.


## Example

In the code sample below, `Child.render()` overrides the virtual member `Base.render()`:

```ts
class Base {
  /** @virtual */
  public render(): void {
  }

  /** @sealed */
  public initialize(): void {
  }
}

class Child extends Base {
  /** @override */
  public render(): void;
}
```
