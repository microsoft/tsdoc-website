1. Make sure the Rush tool is installed, following the
[Building the projects]({% link pages/contributing/building.md %}) instructions.

2. Install dependencies for all projects in the monorepo:

   ```shell
   # Run this command in the folder where you cloned the TSDoc repo from GitHub
   $ rush install
   ```

   > Note: After you run `rush install`, your repo will be in a "Rush-linked" state,
   > with special symlinks in the node_modules folders.  DO NOT run `npm install` in this state.
   > If you want to go back to working in standalone mode, first run `rush unlink && rush purge`.

3. Build and test all the projects in the monorepo:

   ```shell
   $ rush build
   ```

   You can also build just the **@microsoft/tsdoc** library like this:

   ```shell
   $ cd ./tsdoc
   $ npm run build
   ```

4. Manual testing:  Before submitting your PR, you should also try running the
   [/api-demo](./api-demo/) and [/playground](./playground) projects to make sure they
   weren't broken by your change.

5. Change logs:  If your PR modifies the published NPM package, you will need to write a
   change entry for our [CHANGELOG.md](./tsdoc/CHANGELOG.md) change log.  Please read the
   "[recommended practices](https://rushjs.io/pages/best_practices/change_logs/)" for
   authoring change logs.

   ```shell
   $ rush change
   # (The tool will ask you to write a sentence describing your change.)
   ```

   The `rush change` command will create a file under the **common/changes** folder.
   Add this file to Git and include in your pull request.  Please see
   [Everyday commands](https://rushjs.io/pages/developer/everyday_commands/) for
   more details about how these files are used.
